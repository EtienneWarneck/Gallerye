# Gallerye

Group proecjt during Bootcamp in Fullstack dev.

Project: Gallerye is an open-source E-commerce art site that allows users to buy/sell artworks directly sourced from individual artists. It represents a virtual gallery that has infinite capacity and the ability for each artist to represent themselves as a professional in the creative market.

Tools: HTML, CSS, AWS, SQL, Sequelize, Photoshop.

Challenges:

* Ensuring that sign-in/login/logout works.
* Allow artists to upload image files from their computer instead of providing a URL/image address (may need S3 bucket?).
* Paypal or other platform for payment.
