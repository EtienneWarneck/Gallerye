# Gallerye

Problem:

Creatives need a virtual space to display, buy, and sell artwork.

Solution:

Gallerye is an application that will help creatives display their artwork in a virtual gallery setting. Like any museum or gallery you have ever been to, art work is hung or installed for the public to view, learn about, and potentially purchase. Gallerye is briding the gap between the physical gallery and the virtual world.

Utilization:

Creatives and customers will be able to view art for sale and purchase both and digital and physical pieces for themselves. Creatives will also be able to sell their art through the application. 

The Future:
